## Requirements
* Python 3.9 or greater

Unlike openai-whisper, FFmpeg does **not** need to be installed on the system. The audio is decoded with the Python library [PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV) which bundles the FFmpeg libraries in its package.

### GPU

GPU execution requires the following NVIDIA libraries to be installed:

* [cuBLAS for CUDA 12](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas)
* [cuDNN 9 for CUDA 12](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)

**Note**: The latest versions of `ctranslate2` only support CUDA 12 and cuDNN 9. For CUDA 11 and cuDNN 8, the current workaround is downgrading to the `3.24.0` version of `ctranslate2`, for CUDA 12 and cuDNN 8, downgrade to the `4.4.0` version of `ctranslate2`, (This can be done with `pip install --force-reinstall ctranslate2==4.4.0` or specifying the version in a `requirements.txt`).

There are multiple ways to install the NVIDIA libraries mentioned above. The recommended way is described in the official NVIDIA documentation, but we also suggest other installation methods below. 

## Installation

The module can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/faster-whisper/):

```bash
pip install faster-whisper
